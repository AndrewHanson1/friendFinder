I will be resubmitting for a regrade. I didn't have time to complete this activity.
My Psuedo Code is underneath

**I was planning on doing this assignment this morning until before class (5/14) but unfortunately had to deal with a family emergency at the ER. I will be psuedo coding this assignment for this reason. **

//First I would set up an express server on a file named server.js
here i would create my express server and link the html and api routes js files

//then i would set up my HTML route on a file named htmlRoutes.js
i would need two routes here, one for the surver and one that defaults to a home page.

//next i would set up my api routes on apiRoutes.js
here i would have two routes, a Get request to display all the friends from my data from my friends.js, and another route that would handle the POSTS from the survey form.

//i would store the POSTS into an array in app/data/friends.js 

//the users inputs from the survey would be stored in an array and compared with other users to determine the best match, when submitted the users inputs will be compared to all existing Data and calculate their total difference.
the user with the lowest total difference would be the best match and would display on a modal
